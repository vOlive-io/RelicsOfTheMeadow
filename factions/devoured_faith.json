  "overview": "They worship what devours them. They kneel to the hunger they cannot escape.",
  "fullLore": "When the Horde’s wrath scorched the land, not all who survived clung to vengeance. Some sought meaning in ruin—and found it in the dark mouths of what came next. The Devoured Faith was born from desperation, a cult that turned surrender into sanctity. They believe the world’s decay is divine and that to be consumed—by plague, by war, by the gods themselves—is to achieve purity.\n\nThe Faith thrives beneath cathedrals of bone and fungus, their hymns echoing in caverns carved by hunger. They trade in despair, offering salvation through sacrifice and control through devotion. Their priests wield relics and rot alike, scavenging from what others leave behind. Rather than wage open war, they drift in after destruction, harvesting whatever remains—land, relics, or lives. Their rituals are quiet and unsettling, transforming ruin into resource.\n\nUnlike structured nations, the Faith has no stable government—only belief. Their leaders, chosen from a set of ever-shifting prophets, rise and fall in constant cycles of ascension, arrest, and replacement. Each one brings new doctrine, but the hunger beneath never changes. In gameplay, they alone can steal relics from other factions, feeding their power through theft and devotion. They earn points by scavenging relics and resources from abandoned or devastated regions, turning desolation into strength. Though their rituals may appear ominous, the Faith are not destroyers—they are the quiet cleanup crew of the fallen world, inheritors of what others abandon. Their obsession with relics, however, corrodes their surroundings, slowly draining their resilience as their faith’s hunger spreads across the land.",
